## Description
<!-- Plugin description -->
This plugin addresses missing functionality when working with Dart/Flutter, specifically the pain of creating tests in a package structure that reflects the implementation code.

Features:

- alt+enter on a class name to generate a test inside the tests folder following the same relative path.
- Right click on a dart file to create a test file, via the new file menu, in the test folder in the same relative location.
- Right click inside the test folder to create a test in that location.
- All tests come with the test package as imported and the bare bones to create a test.

Create a Dart Test file from the "New Item" menu, give it a name and watch it *magically* create the test in the right folder .

All tests are generated ready to go with the basic elements filled in. Groups and Widget tests coming soon!

### Future work

- Create other types of test e.g. widget and test groups.
- Allow the path to unit, widget and integration tests to be configurable.
